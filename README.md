# Shift Planning Deployment Of Development Environment

The deployment is done using ansible and podman.

All containers are ran on the same machine.

## Implementation Plan for Automated Development Environment Deployment

This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of automated deployment for the development environment on a single VPS with HAProxy, firewalld, and git-based updates.

### Prerequisites
- Single VPS with CentOS/RHEL/Fedora or Ubuntu
- Ansible installed on deployment machine
- SSH access to VPS with sudo privileges
- Domain name pointing to VPS (optional, can use IP)

### Step 1: Setup Base System Dependencies
**Commit Goal**: Install and configure required system packages and services

- Install Podman and Podman Compose
- Install and configure firewalld
- Install HAProxy
- Install git and other required utilities
- Create deployment user with appropriate permissions
- Verify all services are running and enabled

**Test**: All required packages installed, services running, deployment user can manage containers

### Step 2: Configure firewalld Security Rules
**Commit Goal**: Implement proper firewall configuration to secure the VPS

- Configure firewalld zones and rules
- Allow only HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) from external networks
- Allow SSH (22) from trusted networks only
- Block direct access to application ports (3000, 3100, 3200, 5432)
- Configure internal network rules for container communication
- Add logging for dropped packets

**Test**: External access only possible on ports 80/443, internal services not accessible externally

### Step 3: Setup Git Repository Synchronization
**Commit Goal**: Implement automated git-based code deployment

- Configure git repository access (SSH keys or token)
- Create deployment script for pulling latest changes
- Implement git hooks or polling mechanism for updates
- Add rollback capability to previous commit
- Configure environment-specific branch handling (dev/staging/prod)
- Add pre-deployment validation checks

**Test**: Git pull updates code, deployment can be triggered, rollback works

### Step 4: Configure HAProxy for Load Balancing and Rate Limiting
**Commit Goal**: Setup HAProxy as reverse proxy with security features

- Configure HAProxy to proxy requests to gateway service
- Implement rate limiting per IP address
- Add SSL/TLS termination (with Let's Encrypt integration)
- Configure health checks for backend services
- Add logging and monitoring capabilities
- Implement request filtering and security headers
- Configure graceful service switching during deployments

**Test**: HAProxy routes traffic correctly, rate limiting works, SSL certificates valid

### Step 5: Enhance Ansible Playbook for Production Deployment
**Commit Goal**: Extend existing Ansible configuration for production use

- Add HAProxy configuration management to playbooks
- Integrate firewalld configuration tasks
- Add git repository management tasks
- Implement zero-downtime deployment strategy
- Add service health checks and validation
- Configure log management and rotation
- Add backup and restore procedures for database

**Test**: Ansible playbook deploys complete stack, health checks pass, logs properly configured

### Step 6: Implement Container Registry and Image Management
**Commit Goal**: Setup proper container image lifecycle management

- Configure local container registry (or external registry integration)
- Add image building and versioning in CI/CD pipeline
- Implement image vulnerability scanning
- Add automated image cleanup policies
- Configure image pull secrets and authentication
- Add container health monitoring

**Test**: Images built and stored properly, old images cleaned up, vulnerability scans run

### Step 7: Add Monitoring and Alerting
**Commit Goal**: Implement comprehensive monitoring solution

- Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection
- Configure Grafana for visualization
- Add container and service health monitoring
- Configure log aggregation (ELK stack or similar)
- Implement alerting for critical issues (email/Slack)
- Add performance monitoring and capacity planning
- Configure backup monitoring and verification

**Test**: Monitoring dashboards show system health, alerts trigger correctly

### Step 8: Implement Automated Deployment Pipeline
**Commit Goal**: Create fully automated deployment process

- Integrate git webhooks or CI/CD triggers
- Add automated testing before deployment
- Implement blue-green or rolling deployment strategy
- Add automated database migrations
- Configure deployment notifications
- Add deployment approval workflow for production
- Implement automated rollback on failure

**Test**: Push to git triggers deployment, tests run automatically, rollback works on failure

### Step 9: Add Backup and Disaster Recovery
**Commit Goal**: Implement comprehensive backup and recovery procedures

- Configure automated database backups
- Implement configuration and volume backups
- Add backup encryption and secure storage
- Create disaster recovery runbooks
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Configure backup monitoring and verification
- Add point-in-time recovery capabilities

**Test**: Backups run automatically, restoration works, recovery procedures validated

### Step 10: Security Hardening and Compliance
**Commit Goal**: Implement additional security measures and compliance

- Configure SELinux/AppArmor policies
- Implement log monitoring for security events
- Add intrusion detection system (fail2ban)
- Configure regular security updates
- Implement secrets management (Vault integration)
- Add security scanning and compliance reporting
- Configure audit logging

**Test**: Security scans pass, compliance requirements met, audit logs generated

### Step 11: Performance Optimization and Scaling Preparation
**Commit Goal**: Optimize performance and prepare for horizontal scaling

- Implement container resource limits and requests
- Add performance monitoring and optimization
- Configure auto-scaling policies (future multi-node)
- Optimize database performance and connection pooling
- Add CDN integration for static assets
- Implement caching strategies (Redis)
- Performance testing and benchmarking

**Test**: Performance benchmarks meet requirements, resource usage optimized

### Step 12: Documentation and Maintenance Procedures
**Commit Goal**: Complete documentation and operational procedures

- Document all deployment procedures and runbooks
- Create troubleshooting guides
- Add operational maintenance schedules
- Document security procedures and incident response
- Create user guides for deployment management
- Add capacity planning and scaling guidelines
- Complete architecture documentation

**Test**: Documentation complete, procedures tested, team can operate system

### Final Architecture
```
Internet -> firewalld -> HAProxy (80/443) -> Gateway Container (3000)
                                         -> Auth Container (3100)
                                         -> Scheduling Container (3200)
                                         -> Database Container (5432)
```
